===============================
Purchasing Power Calculator
===============================

This is a Flask App based off of the template from 
cookiecutter-flask. The data used to calculate the income needed for equivalent purchasing power is from
the Bureau of Economic Analysis's 2015 regional price parities released on June 22, 2017.


Quickstart
----------

First, set your app's secret key as an environment variable. For example,
add the following to ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile``.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PP_CALCULATOR_SECRET='something-really-secret'

Before running shell commands, set the ``FLASK_APP`` and ``FLASK_DEBUG``
environment variables ::

    export FLASK_APP=/path/to/autoapp.py
    export FLASK_DEBUG=1

Then run the following commands to bootstrap your environment ::

    git clone https://github.com/oanise93/purchasing-power-calculator
    cd pp_calculator
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    bower install
    flask run

You will see a pretty welcome screen.

Once you have installed your DBMS, run the following to create your app's
database tables and perform the initial migration ::

    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade
    flask run


Deployment
----------

In your production environment, make sure the ``FLASK_DEBUG`` environment
variable is unset or is set to ``0``, so that ``ProdConfig`` is used.


Shell
-----

To open the interactive shell, run ::

    flask shell

By default, you will have access to the flask ``app``.


Running Tests
-------------

To run all tests, run ::

    flask test
